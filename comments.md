Great work! Your code looks great. You could DRY things up a little by extracting the PG.connect, connection.exec, and connection.close statements into a method. Also, to comment on your post, I have found myself getting sick and tired of pizza because it is offered at every-single-programming-meetup-ever. I didn't even think that would be possible.
